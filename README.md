# RockPaperScissorsTemplate
Starter code for a Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript

I've supplied you with 
1) the HTML you'll need, 
2) a function for generating a random number between 1 and 3,
3) and the JavaScript code for determining which radio button the player clicked.

Your job is to 
1) get the computer's "choice" (randomly generated)
2) compare the computer's choice to the player's choice and determine who won, or if there was a tie
3) tell the player what the choices were and who won (or if there was a tie)
